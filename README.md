This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Food Recipe Search
My 2nd time to create app in React (^^,)
In this project, I continued to learn creating in ReactJS using Edamam.com's Free API Food Search as data to load from the search bar.
The app would display top 10 recipes according the user's food search. Searched data include Title, Ingredients, Calorie Count and Image. The design was simple card-typed display for each recipes searched.


### Setup locally so it needs to run as follows:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
